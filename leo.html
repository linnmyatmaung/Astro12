                  </p>
                  <p class="more">
                    Individuals born under the sign of Leo are known for their natural
                    leadership abilities. They possess qualities such as creativity,
                    self confidence, dominance and a strong presence that is hard to
                    resist.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra">
                    Leos are capable of achieving anything they set their minds to in
                    all aspects of their lives. The strength of a Leo lies in their
                    "king of the jungle" status. They are typically generous and loyal,
                    which enables them to have many friends. Their self confidence and
                    attractiveness make them capable of bringing different groups of
                    people together and leading them towards a common goal. Additionally
                    Leos have a healthy sense of humor which makes it easier for them to
                    collaborate with others.
                    <br />
                    Leos are associated with the element of Fire, along with Aries and
                    Sagittarius. This makes them warm hearted, and they love to enjoy
                    life and have fun. They are able to use their intellect to solve
                    even the most challenging problems and will often take the
                    initiative to resolve complicated situations. Ruled by the Sun, Leos
                    revere this fiery entity both literally and metaphorically. They are
                    constantly in search of self awareness and personal growth. They are
                    aware of their desires and personalities, and they are comfortable
                    asking for what they need. However in their pursuit of personal gain
                    or status, they may unconsciously neglect the needs of others. If a
                    Leo becomes too attached to their achievements and how others
                    perceive them, they may become vulnerable and easily taken down.

                  <h1>Leo Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Passionate, intense, and fiery, Leo loves hard. For Leos, love
                    itself—whether falling in love, thinking about love, making love—is
                    one of their favorite things in the world. A busy Lion will always
                    make sure that there's plenty of time for passion in his or her
                    life.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                    Falling in love is easy for Lions. But finding a person who can
                    match them and staying in love can be tough. Leo loves flirting and
                    dating, and has no problem penciling new names onto the calendar.
                    This sign loves the rollercoaster that is romance, from butterflies
                    before the first date to catching their breath after the first time
                    in bed. But while Lions thrive on the novelty of dating, they can be
                    easily disappointed if their date fails to live up to their outsize
                    expectations. That's why Leos occasionally finds true love with
                    partners they may have dated or broken up with in the past.
                    <br />
                    In the bedroom, Leo is playful, and frequently imagines that he or
                    she is performing. Your Leo lover may want to capture your shared
                    carnal experience on video or, at the very least, have a few
                    strategically placed mirrors in the room. Leo loves dirty talk
                    (especially praise for a job well done). Giving and generous when it
                    comes to sex, Leo can spend hours pleasuring a partner—as long as
                    the partner returns the favor.

                  <input type="checkbox" id="btn1" />

                <h1>Leo Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                  "Friends" is one of Leo's favorite words, and Lions are known for
                  collecting friends—but not in a transactional way. Leo genuinely
                  adores other people, and innately gets that the more people you know,
                  the easier life can be. Leos easily hand out their phone number, are
                  quick to follow or DM on Instagram, and will invite you to their happy
                  hour five minutes after meeting you. But getting to know a Leo on a
                  deeper level can be challenging. For starters, it's tough to pin down
                  someone with that kind of social schedule. And although Lions are
                  friendly, they won't share their inner emotional life until they're
                  really close with you. A Leo is a valuable ally in your social circle,
                  and when he or she does reveal secrets, listen up and feel honored!
                </p>

                <h1>Three reasons why Leos make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    Generous to a fault, Leo will always surprise you with spontaneous
                    gifts, whether it's a just a latte or something bigger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This sign is the life of a party, which means that you're
                    automatically an A-lister when you're spending time with a Leo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A master connector, Leo will never leave your life. You may hear
                    from a busy Lion only once in a decade, but in minutes you'll be
                    laughing about old times and catching up together.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <br /><br />

                  <strong>Leos are amazing!</strong> Their name says it all:<br /><br />

                  <p class="career-strength">
                    <strong>Leo's greatest career strength:</strong> Passion. Leos bring
                    fiery intensity to everything they do, including work, and when they
                    believe in what they're doing, there's no stopping them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="career-challenge">
                    <strong>Leo's greatest career challenge:</strong> Teamwork. Lions
                    like to do things themselves, and they have a certain way of getting
                    things done. Letting others take the reins can be tough.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra2">
                    Leos are highly energetic and tend to always be busy, regardless of
                    their employment needs. They are ambitious, creative, and
                    optimistic. Once they dedicate themselves to their work, they strive
                    for perfection. The best possible situation for a Leo is to be their
                    own boss or to manage others with minimal control from superiors.
                    Jobs that allow for open expression of artistic talent, such as
                    acting and entertainment, are ideal for Leos. Management, education,
                    and politics are also good fits, as well as anything that puts them
                    in a leadership position, which naturally suits them.
                    <br />Leos love to be surrounded by modern and trendy things.
                    Although money comes easily to them, they may not always spend it
                    responsibly compared to other zodiac signs. They are extremely
                    generous and may provide financial help to many friends, supporting
                    them through difficult times. Although this may not always be wise,
                    it always makes Leos feel good.
                  </p>
