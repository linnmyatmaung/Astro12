                  </p>
                  <p class="more">
                    Pisces is a very friendly sign, often finding themselves in the
                    company of diverse people. They are selfless and always willing to
                    help others, which is admirable as long as they don't expect too
                    much in return.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra">
                    Individuals born with their Sun in Pisces possess an intuitive
                    understanding of the life cycle, forming incredible emotional
                    relationships with others based on the natural order and their
                    senses. Pisces is a Water sign, which concludes the cycle of Cancer
                    and Scorpio, dispersing everything that happened in the past and
                    changing people's relative views on forgiveness. Pisces individuals
                    are characterized by empathy and incredible emotional capacity, but
                    only if they maintain strong boundaries and do not let external
                    emotions overwhelm them. The ruling planets of Pisces are Neptune
                    and Jupiter, and intuition is their strongest suit. <br />
                    Pisces individuals are connected to art, music, and any form of
                    liberal expression, and every representative of this sign possesses
                    a talent they need to use to feel creative and free. While tolerant
                    and compassionate, they can sometimes do too much for others out of
                    good intentions, forgetting about their own wellbeing in the
                    process.

                  <h1>Pisces' Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Pisces in love is passionate, intense, and singular. A relationship
                    with a Pisces is a roller-coaster ride that will make you feel your
                    feelings—even the bad ones—and help you emerge as a better, more
                    honest person. Even if a relationship with a Pisces doesn't last,
                    the lessons you learn from a Pisces partner will.<br />
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                    A Pisces will go all-in when it comes to romance, and expects their
                    partner to do the same. It's not as if a Pisces is clingy—on the
                    contrary, a Pisces can seem incredibly independent while in a
                    relationship—but a Pisces constantly views the world as if from a
                    split-screen: The world through their eyes, and the world through
                    their partner's eyes. They're always trying to make the choices that
                    are the best for both parties, and even small decisions, like where
                    to order Seamless, are made with that perspective in mind.<br />
                    A Pisces wants their partner to grow, and demands that their partner
                    brings their very best self to the relationship. That may cause some
                    partners to feel like they're being pushed away, as a Pisces partner
                    will likely say of course they should seek a promotion, more time at
                    the gym, or a goal, even if it means spending time apart. <br />
                    For Pisces, the physical, spiritual, and intellectual are deeply
                    intertwined, and in relationships, physicality is an important
                    manifestation of love. Pisces can be incredibly sensual when they're
                    feeling deeply in love, but isn't a sign that ever fakes anything.
                    Pisces demands full presence in a relationship, and is especially
                    hurt by any sort of deception. A Pisces demands full honesty and
                    gives the same in return.

                <h1>Pisces' Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                      A Pisces can feel like a great friend—until you consider how much you
                      actually know about them. While Pisces are natural therapists within
                      the Zodiac, they can be cagey about who they are, never revealing
                      their full selves until they trust you—and sometimes, they may never
                      reveal who they truly are. A Pisces can sometimes seem chilly and
                      reserved to acquaintances, and it may seem hard to pull them out of
                      their shell. <br />
                      Pisces are loyal, but their ultimate loyalty is to themselves. They
                      will only give people in their lives so many chances, and they will
                      not sacrifice their health and well-being for that of someone else. A
                      Pisces makes their terms clear, and will always be who they are in a
                      friendship situation. This can be maddening—for example, a Pisces
                      won't play nice and head to a restaurant for another friend's birthday
                      dinner if she hates that restaurant or feels like she's been wronged
                      there—but remember: It's not personal.
                </p>

                <h1>Three reasons why Pisces make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    They're so tapped into culture. Whether you need the next great
                    designer, podcast everyone's going to be talking about, or new app,
                    a Pisces has the best recommendations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They let you feel. How many times have you heard a friend say "it's
                    going to be okay,"—when you're not sure if that's the case? A Pisces
                    won't say that. Instead, they'll let you go to the depths of
                    despair, staying by your side the whole time. In that, they can help
                    you realize that the worst is never the worst when you have a friend
                    by your side.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They have a unique way of seeing the world. You'll never be bored
                    hanging out with a Pisces. A Pisces can always come up with fun
                    things to do—even if the two of you have zero dollars between the
                    two of you. Even a Netflix session is made more interesting by the
                    unique perspective Pisces brings to life.

                    <strong>Pisces' greatest career strength:</strong> Detachment.
                    Pisces can care passionately about a project, but they also know
                    that success and failure are temporary. Learning to let go, let
                    things flow, and that nothing can be guaranteed can allow Pisces to
                    change course mid-stream, try new avenues to success, and let go if
                    a career doesn't seem to be working.

                    <strong>Pisces' greatest career challenge:</strong> Working in
                    corporate-style "teams." Pisces tend to do their best work solo, and
                    Pisces may resent corporate culture. One of the hardest things for a
                    Pisces to learn is the chain of command; Pisces often wants to act
                    because they believe it's right, not because a manager approves it.
                    Having to wait for a corporate sign-off, or having to accept equal
                    billing with corporate "team" members can be ongoing challenges for
                    independent Pisces.

                  <p class="extra2">
                    Pisces are intuitive and dreamy individuals who thrive in positions
                    where their creative skills can be utilized or in jobs that involve
                    working for a higher cause through creative charity events.
                    Occupations that suit Pisces are compassionate, requiring faith and
                    devotion. They often make excellent priests, doctors, veterinarians,
                    musicians, painters and any career that involves working behind the
                    scenes. They can have a lot of fun playing certain roles and hiding
                    their true identity. Money is not usually a top priority for Pisces.
                    They tend to focus on their dreams and goals and will only strive to
                    earn enough money to achieve them. Depending on the power of their
                    dreams and the sense of purpose they were raised to develop, each
                    Pisces representative will spend as much as necessary to pursue
                    their goals.
