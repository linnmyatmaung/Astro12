                  <p class="more">
                    Cancer is a zodiac sign that is deeply intuitive and sentimental,
                    making them one of the most challenging signs to get to know.

                    They are highly emotional and sensitive, and prioritize matters
                    related to family and home. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are
                    very loyal and empathetic to the pain and suffering of others. As a
                    Water sign, just like Scorpio and Pisces, Cancer is guided by their
                    emotions and heart, and can have difficulty fitting into the world
                    around them. Ruled by the Moon, their internal mysteries are
                    deepened by the phases of the lunar cycle, creating fleeting
                    emotional patterns that are often beyond their control. As children,
                    they may lack coping and defensive mechanisms for the outer world,
                    and require care and understanding to navigate it successfully.

                  <h1>Cancer's Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Cancers sometimes get frustrated that their partner doesn't know
                    everything that's going on in their internal life, and they can
                    easily put up walls and say it's all good when everything is clearly
                    the exact opposite.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                    In order to truly connect, Cancers must be patient with their
                    partner and voice their emotional needs—and these lessons can have a
                    steep learning curve for this sign. Crabs want a partner who can
                    bear witness to their emotional ups and downs, yet they can lash out
                    if their partner tries to "fix" things. Sometimes, all Cancer needs
                    to do is vent. In bed, Cancer is happiest with long, passionate
                    lovemaking. While props, toys, and shower sex can all be fun,
                    Cancer's absolute favorite is any position that allows plenty of eye
                    contact with his or her lover. Crabs want to cuddle after sex (if
                    they feel trusted and in love), and they're always up for a lazy day
                    spent entirely under the covers.
                    <br />
                    This sign plays for keeps, and believes in in his or her partner.
                    Sometimes, Crabs may struggle with letting a relationship end, and
                    their breakups may have to happen several times before they accept
                    that it's really over. On the flip side, Cancer takes loyalty very
                    seriously, and a breach of loyalty, however small it seems, can be a
                    deal-breaker for a Cancer.

                <h1>Cancer' Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                      Cancers may turn down the first invite you give them. They may even
                      turn down the fifth. But once they finally say yes, know that you may
                      have found a real friend. While Cancers, like their spirit animal the
                      Crab, are known for their thick outer shell, trust that the
                      standoffishness is all an act. Get a bit below the surface, and you'll
                      find that a Cancer is all feelings. <br />
                      Cancers love deep conversations, but they also have pretty firm
                      boundaries around "their" time. Don't be offended if they turn down an
                      invite—chances are, they truly need the downtime. And Crabs can be
                      possessive—especially of the friends they love. If they don't like
                      your other friends, they may turn prickly. But hear them out. Cancers
                      have an excellent sense of people's true colors, and there may be a
                      good reason they want you to stay away from someone.

                <h1>Three reasons why Cancer make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    Intelligent Cancer will tell you exactly what's going on in any
                    situation, providing spot-on analysis of everything in your life,
                    from personal relationships to political developments.

                  <li>
                    Creative Cancer always has a unique perspective on the world. This
                    sign is your go-to for book and playlist recommendations, and loves
                    talking through what a work of art actually means, rather than just
                    stopping at "Did you like it?"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cancer always has your back. Even if you don't feel like you have a
                    grip or you're being hard on yourself for something, Cancer will
                    tell you all the ways that you bring joy and love into the world.

                    Affiliated with Artemis, goddess of the hunt, Cancer knows which way
                    the wind will blow, work-wise, before there's a memo or email.
                    Cancer is adept at reading people, and, as the Zodiac sign most
                    closely associated with mothers and wombs, the Crab is intuitively
                    respected as the manager who will fix things, guide colleagues, and

                    out of the equation. In some ways, Cancers' emotional connection to
                    their work is an asset. When they feel passion, they will pull
                    countless all-nighters to finish a project. But there's a flip side:

                    passive-aggressively by delivering sloppy work.

                    individuals are dependable and hardworking, willing to roll up their

                    employer and a strong focus on the task at hand. Their well-suited

                    Job security and financial stability are of great importance to
                    Cancer representatives, and serve as the primary motivation for
                    their diligent work. They tend to accumulate wealth and are cautious
                    about spending it all at once. Their goal is to save, invest, and
                    observe their investments grow over time. They are resourceful and
                    skilled in managing time and finances, often overseeing all
                    household finances and controlling their partner or other family
                    members' spending.
