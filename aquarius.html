                  <p class="more">
                    Aquarius is one of the most unique signs of the zodiac, and people
                    born under this sign experience a sense of uniqueness.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra">
                    This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom,
                    or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality.
                    In both cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people
                    who love to fight for idealistic causes. They can see people without
                    prejudice, making them truly special. Although they can easily adapt
                    to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a
                    deep need for alone time to restore their inner power.
                    <br />
                    The sign of Aquarius belongs to the element of Air, finishing the
                    story of Gemini and Libra and connecting them through the opposition
                    of freedom and relationships. They rely on their mind and spoken
                    words most of the time, and without mental stimulation, they might
                    lose interest even in things that initially excited them. They see
                    the world as a place full of possibilities and have a need to be
                    spontaneous, follow the moment, and live life to the fullest, never
                    wasting precious time. <br />
                    Uranus is the ruler of Aquarius, with its traditional ruler Saturn
                    by its side. Although Uranus has an abrupt, timid, and sometimes
                    aggressive nature, the presence of Saturn grounds them enough to
                    help them find the distance they need from other people to remain
                    somewhat indifferent. Aquarians are visionaries and are always ready
                    for change, known for their intellectual abilities and for shaking
                    up the world once they're in it. They feel best as part of a certain
                    community, but they might have trouble finding the right place where
                    they truly feel they belong.

                  <h1>Aquarius Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Aquarius in love may march to the beat of their own drummer—the
                    free-love era wasn't named "The Age of Aquarius" for nothing.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                    Aquarius doesn't take a lot of stock in what "should" be done, but
                    Aquarius has their own rules, codes of ethics, and morality and
                    takes all three incredibly seriously. Aquarius may be skittish when
                    it comes to love. While they enjoy flirtatious relationships and can
                    easily be in a longterm "friends with benefits" situation, love—even
                    when they have deep feelings for the other person—can lead them to
                    feel trapped or scared of the future. An Aquarius doesn't want to
                    depend on another person, and they don't want someone else to depend
                    on them. Trying to navigate healthy codependence in a relationship
                    is a lifelong Aquarius challenge.

                    <br />
                    Aquarius is physically passionate, honest, and very in tune with
                    their sexuality. An Aquarius may find sex connects them more deeply
                    to themselves, as well as their partner, and believes that sex can
                    exist outside of love. An Aquarius cares deeply about their partner,
                    but believes that love is not asking another person to put the other
                    person's needs ahead of their own. An Aquarius in love isn't
                    selfish, they're pragmatic, and they're doing what's most honest for
                    them.
                  </p>

                <h1>Aquarius Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                      Aquarius will always take the initiative to meet someone and hear
                      their story. Aquarians love finding connections to other people, and
                      never feel self-conscious or out of place, even in a group of
                      strangers. Good listeners and natural questioners, Aquarians can draw
                      out anyone, getting a new acquaintance to tell an Aquarian things
                      they've barely told anyone else before. But there is another side:
                      Aquarius can be very private, and people think they know an Aquarius
                      much better than they do. Aquarius likes having a large social circle,
                      but cultivating close friends takes time and trust. Aquarius takes
                      disappointment in friendships seriously, and takes it hard—a cancelled
                      coffee meet-up won't make an Aquarius hold a grudge, but it will be a
                      long time (if ever) they'll invite you closer into their social
                      circle.
                </p>

                <h1>Three reasons why Aquarians make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    They're fun. They'll never say no to an idea, and when they're at a
                    party or event, they commit 100% of their energy to it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They have amazing perspective. Aquarians are good at making
                    connections between random things, and are the best at recommending
                    the perfect podcast or movie for whatever issue you're facing in
                    your own life.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They push you. An Aquarius will check to make sure you hit your
                    deadlines, scheduled that review with your boss, or updated your
                    LinkedIn. They're not doing this because they want to control you,
                    but because they know that doing your best is what will make you
                    happy.
                  </li>

                  <p class="career-strength">
                    <strong>Aquarius' greatest career strength:</strong> Unflappability.
                    Aquarians can juggle a lot of balls, but they never seem stressed.
                    They don't feel stressed, either. By focusing on the here and now,
                    Aquarius is good at tuning out any noise or self-doubt, and getting
                    the job done.

                  <p class="career-challenge">
                    <strong>Aquarius' greatest career challenge:</strong> Bureaucracy.
                    An Aquarius has a good idea of how things should be done, and could
                    probably do them better than whatever current system is in place.
                    Aquarius needs to learn to adapt to what the boss may want—even if
                    it's slower and more time consuming than what they might have done.
                  </p>

                    This is a sign that brings enthusiasm, excitement, and innovation to
                    the workplace and has a remarkable ability to exploit their
                    imagination for business purposes. Their high intellect combined
                    with their willingness to share their talents inspires many people
                    in their lives. They are visionaries who like to engage in humane
                    activities and need to work in a place that supports better
                    circumstances for endangered groups of people.
                    <br />The finances of this zodiac sign can be spent on various risks
                    but can also be saved. All they need to create a saving zone is
                    something to look forward to. They are well-adapted to their sense
                    of style and are not afraid to show it. This is why their choice of
                    colors can make a difference in their emotional state. They can
                    excel in professions such as piloting, paragliding, and photography
                    but they also make excellent programmers, ingenious mathematicians,
                    and scientists. They often need to be able to show their personality
                    without many strict guidelines for the way they do so.
