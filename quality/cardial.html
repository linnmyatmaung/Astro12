                Cardinal quality represents all new beginnings and the energy of things that are just starting. Each sign of this
                quality has the ability to make a sharp turn, and change their life and the life of others. If you look around
                you, it will become clear that everyone you know born only under one of these Sun signs, had or wants to have
                the opportunity for a deep change of direction and focus in life. Sings of cardinal modality are 
                <a href="../aries.html">Aries</a>,
                <a href="../cancer.html">Cancer</a>,
                <a href="../libra.html">Libra</a> and
                <a href="../capricorn.html">Capricorn</a>. Each of them represents a beginning of one season, and this makes them innovative and new.

                        This sign belongs to the element of Fire and begins with the first day of spring when all of nature is waking up,
                        while life begins to bloom. This is a sign of the beginning of one circle, the first sign of the zodiac, and the
                        leader in every sense of the word. An Aries leads the way from point zero, bravely, with a masculine forceful
                        energy that clears the way in front of them. Aries relies on infinite energy, but when they get to a wall they
                        can’t break through (and after numerous attempts), they will make a cut and move in a completely new direction.
