                This is the quality of all signs that have already had enough and need change. They all look forward to the new season, whatever it is, and they are already a mix of the old with the new. We can’t say that they represent the end of something, but rather a combination of an end with a new beginning, intertwined. This is a quality of constant changes and the unexpected, and something that brings message of the future and what is yet to come. All of the signs with this quality have the ability to sense things before they arrive, and many of those gifted individuals that foretell our future have these areas of the zodiac accented. Mutable signs are

                        Gemini is a mutable sign that belongs to the element of Air. This makes it the most changeable and “windy” of all signs in the zodiac. It has real trouble connecting to planet Earth, and interestingly, the other side of its ruler Mercury is represented through Virgo, the Earth sign that shares the same quality. The sign of Gemini begins at the end of spring, in preparations for the summer. we can just imagine the Sun in the center of our solar system, brightly burning for millions of years and prepared to do so for millions of years to come. It guarantees our future and our lives, for as long as we take care of our bodies and our own planet.

                        Virgo is the “other side” of Mercury, practical and easy to comprehend, and also its sign of exaltation. It belongs to the element of Earth and represents the end of summer, when we still enjoy the warmth but look forward to a cooler time of the year. To add to that, this is a sign that holds the fall of Venus as if Virgos look forward to the colors of the autumn to regenerate from aggressive mental and hormonal summer activity. Virgo sign does rule our health and our physiology, and speaks of changes in the way our body functions daily following waves of our routine.

                        Sagittarius is a mutable sign belonging to the element of Fire that comes at the end of autumn. You will often see that a person born with the Sun in Sagittarius honestly and truly looks forward to the winter. This is the time of year when optimism actually has a purpose, and after all that dying in the sign of Scorpio and the middle of autumn, it speaks of a time when the future is evident, there at the grab of our hand, and couldn’t possibly be any worse than the past. It is a time of peaceful sleep that leads to something interesting and deep that covers tracks of life, and opens us up to it in the spring.

                        The sign of Pisces is a Water sign of mutable quality and speaks of the change in our waters. It starts at the end of winter and prepares us for the beginning of spring. Even though it is said that the night is darkest before the dawn, Pisces know that there is light and life ahead. They have something to live for, their mission and a goal, feeling the upcoming life that is about to blossom in the next couple of months. The sign of Pisces might be the sign of ends, but it is also a place of change from death to life, and from darkness to light. It is the sweet expectation of spring.
