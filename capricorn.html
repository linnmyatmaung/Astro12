                    Capricorn is a sign that is associated with time and responsibility.
                    Capricorn individuals are typically traditional and serious in nature,
                   possessing an inner sense of independence that allows them to make
                   significant progress in both their personal and professional lives.
                   They are skilled in self-control, can make realistic plans,and
                   are capable of managing many people at once. Capricorns learn from
                   their mistakes and rely on their experience and expertise to achieve success.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra">
                    Belonging to the Earth element, like Taurus and Virgo, Capricorns are
                     the last sign in the trio of practicality and grounding. They are
                    focused on the material world and are adept at using its resources.
                    However, this element can also make them inflexible and stubborn,
                    particularly in their relationships. They may struggle to accept
                    the differences of others that are too far from their own character, 
                    and out of fear, may try to impose their own traditional values.

                    <br />
                    he ruling planet of Capricorn is Saturn, which represents all forms of
                    restriction. While its influence makes Capricorns practical and responsible,
                    it can also make them cold, distant, and unforgiving. They may struggle with 
                    feelings of guilt or rride and become fixated on the past. To lighten 
                    their own lives and become more positive, Capricorns need to learn to forgive.

                  <h1>Capricorn Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Ruled by strict Saturn, Capricorn knows, expects, and even relishes
                    the tough parts of relationships. They are in it for the long haul,
                    and know the best relationships have storms. It’s not as if they are
                    fatalistic—but Capricorn's love is realistic and they aren’t going 
                    to have a rosy view of romance.
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                        That said, Capricorns are expansive and generous in love, and adore 
                        being wined and dined. They love the formality of early dating, and 
                        may be quite strict about following “the rules” of romance—even if 
                        those rules are made up. Typically, they may follow gender norms of 
                        dating, expecting the man to call first and the man to pay on 
                        the first date, but Capricorn isn’t strict, and is always willing 
                        to consider another path or another way. Capricorns can be regimented, 
                        and love having a specific night of the week for date night. 
                        Capricorns thrive on routine, and may love staying at home on weekends,
                        under the covers, with nothing but them and their lover. Capricorns love 
                        spending time only with their lover, especially in the early stages of 
                        a relationship, which can be frustrating to their friends and family.
                      </br>
                        Capricorns are serious monogamists, and although they can be cautious
                         in every other aspect of their lives, they are the sign who is likely 
                         to fall deeply in love with someone, and it’s not unusual for a Capricorn 
                         to get married after only several months of dating. They know 
                         their hearts well, and don’t hesitate to lock things down when they know
                        that the relationship is right. And their instincts are on 
                        point—loyal Capricorns stay in relationships for the long haul. 
                        They aren’t afraid oftherapy if their relationship needs help, 
                        and approach problems as a bump in the road, capable of fixing 
                        with honesty, trust, and hard work from both partners.

                <h1>Capricorn Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                    Loyal, loving, and all about tradition, inside jokes, and 
                    the shared stories that make up friendship, Capricorn takes
                    friendships incredibly seriously. They love taking care of 
                    their friends, and may make dinner, clean their closet, or 
                    use whatever their Capricorn strengths are to help make their 
                    friends lives better. Capricorn pushes their friends to the max, 
                    and isn’t afraid to let their friends know if they are disappointed 
                    in their actions and behaviors. Capricorn will not let bad behavior 
                    go unnoticed, and will gently call out a friend who may have forgotten
                     a birthday, complete with a reminder—like a gift of a calendar—to ensure
                    it won’t happen again. A Capricorn knows that they may not always be 
                    the “fun” friend—if they go on a friend trip or bachelor or 
                    bachelorette party, they want to be in bed by ten—but they also know 
                    that they bring some pretty great gifts to the table. A Capricorn inspires 
                    and challenges their friends, and expects the same in return.
                </p>

                <h1>Three reasons why Capricorn make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    They are loyal. They will always have your back, even if 
                    they don’t agree with what you are doing. They may get a bit 
                    parental in giving you lectures, but it’s only because they 
                    care and want what is best for you.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They remember everything. When you come to their house, 
                    your favorite wine is chilling, and they never have to 
                    guess your shoe or shirt size for birthdays. They remember 
                    the names of every family member and every ex—for better 
                    or worse—and you sometimes feel like they know your history 
                    even better than you know your own.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They recognize your gifts and strengths. Sometimes, 
                    it feels like the Capricorn in your life is a therapist/guidance 
                    counselor, but they can push you to where you want to be, 
                    even providing action plans and checklists for how to get there.

                    themselves or from an underling, and knows that there is always a way 
                    to do the impossible.

                  <p class="career-challenge">
                    <strong>Capricorn's greatest career challenge:</strong> Rigidity. 
            Capricorn can follow the rules of a job to a T, but may be passed 
            over for promotions because they may not think outside the box. 
            Capricorns are staid rule followers, and may need to work on thinking 
            beyond the boundaries of a job or task to truly prove their leadership 
            and innovation potential.
                  </p>
            
                  <p class="extra2">
                    Capricorns are known for setting high standards for themselves 
                    and are characterized by their honesty, dedication, and perseverance. 
                    They value loyalty and hard work above all else and tend to keep 
                    those with these qualities close, even if they are intellectually 
                    inferior. Capricorns are concentrated and resourceful individuals 
                    who get the job done and are willing to commit completely to the 
                    final product, even if it requires long hours. They excel in management, 
                    finance, programming, and calculations. Deeply rooted in tradition, 
                    the state, and the system they live in, Capricorns prioritize having 
                    all their paperwork in perfect order, their documents clean, and their files impeccable.
                    <br />
                    Money is highly valued in the lives of Capricorns. They tend to 
                    manage it well and save for a rainy day, as long as their debts 
                    do not consume their actual abilities. Capricorns are hard workers 
                    who strive for a higher cause, and they will do everything in 
                    their power to become debt-free, whether it is from loans or mortgages, 
                    knowing that true success will only come in the long run.
