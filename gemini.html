                    Gemini is a zodiac sign that represents two different personalities
                    in one, making them expressive and quick-witted. They are sociable,
                    communicative, and always ready for fun, but can suddenly become
                    serious, thoughtful, and restless.

                  <p class="extra">
                    Their curiosity about the world knows no bounds, and they often feel
                    like there is not enough time to experience everything they want to
                    see.
                    <br />
                    As an Air sign, Gemini is connected to all aspects of the mind,
                    along with Libra and Aquarius. Mercury rules this sign, representing
                    communication, writing, and movement. Gemini-born individuals often
                    feel like they are missing their other half, constantly seeking new
                    friends, mentors, colleagues, and people to engage with.

                  <h1>Gemini's Love Style</h1>
                  <p class="love-style">
                    Dynamic, intense, and with so many shifting parts to their
                    personalities, Gemini love to date. Indeed, they consider dating a
                    skill. Gemini are great at drawing first dates out of their shells,
                    and they rarely have a "bad" date—because this optimism-infused sign
                    will always finds something positive about the person they meet or
                    the conversation they shared.<br />
                  </p>
                  <p class="extra1">
                    But even though dating is fun, it can be hard for Gemini to take the
                    next step. While the Twins love the idea of love, they're also
                    passionate about their own independence, and they want to make sure
                    that they aren't giving anything up before taking the next step. And
                    while Gemini aren't dishonest, their ruling planet Mercury makes
                    them especially adept at telling others what they want to hear—which
                    some might perceive as leading people on. Gemini aren't bound by
                    convention. If they find themselves partnering with someone isn't
                    the "type" that their friends or family would have expected, well,
                    Gemini just don't care. Once in love, Gemini aren't afraid to make
                    their own rules (with their partner of course) about what the
                    relationship looks like. In bed, Gemini is dynamic, intense, and
                    wants to experience as much as possible. Sensation play—think wax
                    and ice—is a welcome try for a Gemini. And of course, the Twins
                    can't resist contrasts, even in bed. Whether they're exploring
                    quickies or all-day lovemaking marathons, taking the lead or being
                    totally passive, or playing around with different roles and
                    sensations during sex, a Gemini is never bored.

                  <input type="checkbox" id="btn1" />

                <h1>Gemini Friendship Style</h1>
                <p class="friendship">
                      The bad news: Gemini will forget your birthday or flake on a date that
                      you set in the calendar months ago. The good news: It's not personal,
                      and your Gemini friend will make it up to you. Funny, witty, and
                      talking a mile a minute, a Gemini will keep you laughing, and it's
                      likely that some of your best memories involve a Gemini. <br />
                      The Twins can infuse drama and intrigue into even the most
                      same-old-sounding coffee date, and they may surprise you by ordering
                      your lattes in a foreign accent or requesting some custom-made
                      concoction dreamed up in their head. Even though Gemini have tons of
                      friends and their calendar gets packed months out, when they're with
                      you, you're the only person that matters. But even though you may
                      think your Gemini friend knows you well, it may take longer for you to
                      get to know them. Gemini love connecting to people, yet they can guard
                      their own selves and personalities from others.

                <h1>Three reasons why Gemini make great friends</h1>
                <ol class="three-reason">
                  <li>
                    Fun and fearless, a Gemini will push you to achieve your dreams and
                    desires. If you want something done, mention it to Gemini. Skydiving
                    on your bucket list? Don't be surprised if your Gemini friend
                    invites you to meet them at the airfield on your next hangout date.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Gemini are culture connoisseurs. They always know the best book to
                    read, movie to watch, and museum exhibit to explore. They also love
                    sharing their finds with friends, and they can actually explain why
                    a work of art is unique or a masterpiece without making you feel
                    dumb or uneducated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A Gemini notices everything. This sign loves to make other people
                    feel valued, and will always compliment you on your outfit, ideas,
                    or Instagram grid. But they won't BS. When they compliment you, you
                    know it's legit—and it makes you feel great.

                    <strong>Gemini's greatest career strength:</strong> Communication.
                    Inspired by Mercury the messenger, Gemini is an amazing communicator
                    who knows innately how to present ideas for approval. Whether it's
                    standing in front of a meeting, delivering a killer deck, or writing
                    an amazing article, Gemini is a master wordsmith who can either find
                    success in an individualized field (such as writing) or as part of a
                    larger team.

                    detail-oriented "gotta be done" tasks in the middle? Not so much.
                    Gemini prefer to do what they excel at, and they might slow down or
                    sink into frustration if a task or assignment includes steps that
                    aren't in their wheelhouse. Learning how to organize their schedule,
                    work on a deadline, and pay attention to detail will give the Twins
                    a must-have skill set for anyone who wants to hire them.

                    They are skillful, inventive, and often very smart with a need for a
                    dynamic working environment and a lot of social contacts made in the
                    office. The best careers they can choose are those of traders,
                    inventors, writers, orators, preachers, and lawyers. Any career that
                    gives them the opportunity to communicate freely while keeping them
                    on the move and busy at all times is an excellent choice. They are
                    crafted for multitasking, problem-solving and bringing new ideas to
                    life. They need a workplace that won't keep them stuck in routine or
                    a repetitive task that goes not allow them to shine. Deciding
                    between practicality and pleasure can be a difficult choice for
                    Gemini. Even though they might believe that money is just a
                    necessary evil, most Gemini's will not spend much time thinking
                    about where to earn it or how to spend it. They need strong
                    grounding to keep their finances in check and organized, giving them
                    a sense of confidence and security that they often don't even know
                    they need.
