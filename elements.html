                <p><strong>There are four elements of nature relevant for our deeper understanding of Astrology and many other things in life: Earth, Water, Fire and Air. They all have a long history, recognized way before our time.

            <h1>Zodiac And The Elements</h1>
            <p>All four elements speak of certain tendencies each zodiac sign has simply because it belongs to one of them. They help us understand that there are other ways of looking at each individual, give us patience for those that are different from us, and make it clearer why some sings are more compatible than others.<br><br>
            Roughly interpreted, Earth will go well with Water, and Fire will go well with Air. This is quite logical if you think about it, for Water gives Earth its fertility and brings us to life, while Air keeps the Fire burning and sparks the light and our power of creation.

                <h3>Air Signs</h3>
                <p>Signs that represent the element of Air in the zodiac are Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. It is interesting to notice that two of them have a problem with the Sun, Libra taking it to fall and Aquarius to detriment. This is understandable for the Sun keeps all things in order and circling around it, and Air needs to be free to circle the Universe instead.<br><br>
                 Looking at the bigger picture, people born under the strong influence of these signs have a problem fitting into a regular order of their surroundings, no matter if it is their country or their workplace. Their main goal in life is often just to stop pleasing others and worrying about their opinions, so they can be able to follow their brightest and most liberating ideas.

                 <div class="extra">
                <h3>How Do We Balance Air?</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenge for every individual marked by Air is to find grounding and understand the importance of their body. They have a strong tendency to remain in higher spheres, where everything is lighter and seems possible. It is not easy to find a way to implement their ideas, intelligence and knowledge into practical things and truly make them alive.<br><br>
                 To truly succeed in personal growth and overall development, the most important thing for Airy individuals is to stop talking and start doing concrete, practical moves towards fulfillment. They are balanced by the element of Earth and need a healthy daily routine, with their meals repeated at the same time every day, and physical activity to remain aware of their physical existence. If they forget to eat, for example, this hole in their stomach will have an effect on any rational plan they’ve had. The importance of fulfilling their physical needs is primal and irreplaceable.

                <h3 id="fire">Fire Signs</h3>
                <p>The element of Fire is represented in the zodiac through Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. These signs truly uplift the strength of the Sun and each individual born as one of these Sun signs has an assignment to nurture and cherish their emotional side. They often have to be trained for compassion and a deeper understanding of other people, and have basic problems in relationships triggered by their need to give more than they should to those who didn’t ask for anything.<br><br>
                 Each fiery individual has to use their energy solely on their own life, unless if somebody asks for their advice and engagement. Of all three, Sagittarius is the most giving, for they are at the end of this Fire trine, already learned so much, with a strong life philosophy and numerous good intentions.
                 </p>
                 <div class="extra1">
                <h3>How Do We Balance Fire>?</h3>   
                <p>This is the first element with strong masculine energy, and it easily neglects the feminine principles within, burning everything around a person and making all the Water in their body and life evaporate. A life without love isn’t worth living, and in order to make them happier, all fiery people have to respect their emotional side and acknowledge their emotional needs. In the outer world, this translates to their relation to women, suppression of the feminine principle on a wider scale, leading to all sorts of conflicts that ultimately take human life.<br>
                The biggest challenge for anyone guided by the element of Fire is to remain calm and peaceful along the way. With a strong need to move forward, people born with an ascendant or many planets in Fire tend to forget that passive approach is needed as much as an active one. Therapy could do miracles here, for they don’t lack awareness or the excitement when they learn something new and get an opportunity to save or recycle some of their wasted energy.

                <h3 id="water">Water Signs</h3> 
                <p>Signs belonging to the element of Water are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. This makes the entire need of this element a bit complicated, for the ruler of Cancer falls in Scorpio, and Pisces seem to be there to hide its body. Perhaps this is the greatest task of all, for each of us to embrace emotion, accept the negative as much as the positive, anger and sadness as much as love.<br>
                Typical representatives of the element of Air have often been said to be too emotional. They could deal with a lot of suffering before they realize that there is no such thing. Their sensitivity and fragile nature make them perfect for advisors and compassionate therapists, helping those with deep emotional problems. They came to this planet to teach everyone else that love is truly endless and feelings our greatest quality.
               </p> 
               <div class="extra2">
               <h3>How Do We Balance Water?</h3>      
               <p>People with accented element of Water have something to learn about their emotional nature. This is the element of greatest possibilities but often puts us to sleep and makes it impossible for a person to creatively express themselves. This is a field of all talents and everything that was left for us to take in this lifetime. Here lies the river of everyone that lived before us and everyone that is ever going to be born.<br><br>
               Water is a pool of endless possibility and it is almost impossible to find direction in it if there is no contact with Fire. The element of Fire burns bright as a guiding light, and gives person energy, passion and direction where their talents can be found and properly used through creation. Element of Water standing alone simply carries us from shore to shore, from left to right, and even though life can be magical and dreamy inside it, we could simply be spinning in circles without every finding a way out.

                <h3 id="earth">Earth Signs</h3> 
                <p>Signs ruled by the element of Earth are Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. It is instantly obvious that these are all practical signs that value material things, work hard, and know how to make a plan and put it to action. All three of them have the ability to be specific and concrete, expecting everyone else to share their practical view on the world and their reasonable approach.<br>
                Earth represents matter itself, our physical body, and with it our finances, the food we eat, and our daily routine. Strongly set in their ways, individuals with this element accented have a tendency to give in to an unchangeable routine for years, sometimes too scared to get out of it. In a challenging mode, they will stick to habits that don’t make them happy just because they are convinced they have to, or stay at a job because of financial security, while completely neglecting their intelligence and creativity.

                <div class="extra3">
                <h3>How Do We Balance Earth?</h3> 
                <p>The biggest challenge Earth has to face is the recognition of something as fast, unstable and transparent as Air. Earthlings out of balance need to shake off their stiff habits, make changes to their life and their routine without regret, and stop questioning every decision they’ve already made. Their sense of purpose has to be clear and their contact with emotions strong and unshakeable, and this takes a special effort for someone like Virgo, taking Venus into fall.<br><br>
                To get in touch with the element of Air, these individuals should read, have a coffee break, walk aimlessly and socialize as much as possible. They need spoken word rather than a written one, a new computer, people who change places and ambitions to teach them how to move, and a lot of relaxation and stretching to prepare their body for the change. The best exercise for anyone pressured by Earth is dance, spontaneous and carefree, with modern loud music and preferably a relaxed partner.
